## TypeScript

- Typescript Handbook

Over 20 years after its introduction to the programming community, JavaScript is now one of the
most widespread cross-platform languages ever created. Starting as a small scripting language for
adding trivial interactivity to webpages, JavaScript has grown to be a language of choice for both
frontend and backend applications of every size. While the size, scope, and complexity of programs
written in JavaScript has grown exponentially, the ability of the JavaScript language to express the
relationships between different units of code has not. Combined with JavaScript's rather peculiar
runtime semantics, this mismatch between language and program complexity has made JavaScript
development a difficult task to manage at scale.

The most common kinds of errors that programmers write can be described as type errors: a
certain kind of value was used where a different kind of value was expected. This could be due to
simple typos, a failure to understand the API surface of a library, incorrect assumptions about
runtime behavior, or other errors. The goal of TypeScript is to be a static typechecker for JavaScript
programs - in other words, a tool that runs before your code runs (static) and ensures that the types
of the program are correct (typechecked).

If you are coming to TypeScript without a JavaScript background, with the intention of TypeScript
being your first language, we recommend you first start reading the documentation on either the
Microsoft Learn JavaScript tutorial or read JavaScript at the Mozilla Web Docs. If you have
experience in other languages, you should be able to pick up JavaScript syntax quite quickly by
reading the handbook.
